### Config file for monitor_hipat.py
# monitor_hipat performs an <ntpq -pn <ip_address>> query to all addresses specified by <ip_address>. The output is processed and the offset 
# to the reference server given by <ref_ip_address> is printed. A voluntary option is also included to specify a <remote_ip>. 
# This is used in scenarios where a different offset is wanted from a <ntpq -pn> query.
#
# Three things are configured in this file
# 1. remote_status. Two options available, choose one of them:
#       local:      The <ntpq -pn> output is received from a local query.
#       remote:     <ntpq -pn <ip_address>> is performed for every ip address in this config file.
# 2. ref_ip_address. When performing a remote query this is the default ip address to look for in the received <ntpq -pn> output.
# 3. ip_address. The following values are available:
#       ip_address: Ip address to be monitored.
#       name:       Name to be associated with the ip address.
#       remote_ip:  A different output filtering address than the ref_ip_address is wanted. This is an optional parameter.
#
# The following general format is used:
# <config_item>: <value1>:<value2>:<value3>
#
# remote_status: <status>                           # status is remote or local
# ref_ip_address: <ref_ip_address>                  # ip address of the reference server
# ip_address: <ip_address>:<name>[:<remote_ip>]     # remote_ip is optional
#
# Examples given:
# remote_status: remote
# ref_ip_address: 1.2.3.4
# ip_address: 11.22.33.44:name
# ip_address: 11.22.33.44:name:55.66.77.88         # Where 11.22.33.44 is the server to get <ntpq -pn> info from and 55.66.77.88 is the remote_ip.
